-- This file contains definitions for all of the tables with
-- the exception of the price data.
--
-- Price data is stored in a non-SQL format in the top level
-- in a file called "TradeDangerous.prices"
--
-- If either file is changed, TradeDangerous will rebuild it's
-- sqlite3 database the next time it's run.
--
-- You can edit this file, if you really need to, if you know
-- what you are doing. Or you can use the 'sqlite3' command
-- to edit the .db database and then use the '.dump' command
-- to regenerate this file, except then you'll lose this nice
-- header and I might have to wag my finger at you.
