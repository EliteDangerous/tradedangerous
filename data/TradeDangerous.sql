-- Definitions for all of the tables used in the SQLite
-- cache database.
--
-- Source data for TradeDangerous is stored in various
-- ".csv" files which provide relatively constant data
-- such as star names, the list of known tradeable items,
-- etc.
--
-- Per-station price data is sourced from ".prices" files
-- which are designed to be human readable text that
-- closely aproximates the in-game UI.
--
-- When the .SQL file or the .CSV files change, TD will
-- destroy and rebuild the cache next time it is run.
--
-- When the .prices file is changed, only the price data
-- is reset.
--
-- You can edit this file, if you really need to, if you know
-- what you are doing. Or you can use the 'sqlite3' command
-- to edit the .db database and then use the '.dump' command
-- to regenerate this file, except then you'll lose this nice
-- header and I might have to wag my finger at you.
