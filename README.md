#What is Trade Dangerous?

TradeDangerous is set of powerful trading tools for Elite Dangerous, organized around one of the most powerful trade run optimizers (TRO) available.

The TRO is a heavy hitter that can calculate complex routes with multiple-stops while taking into account the profits you make along the route.

The price data in TradeDangerous is either manually entered (by you) or crowd sourced (e.g. [http://www.davek.com.au/td](http://www.davek.com.au/td)).


#What can it do for me?

You're in a ship with 8 cargo spaces that can make 8.56 ly per jump; you're willing to make upto 2 jumps between stations, and we want to see how much money we can make if in 2 trade stops (hops).

    trade.py run --credits 5000 --capacity 8 --ly-per 8.56 --jumps 2 --hops 2

If we ran this, TD would search the galaxy for trade runs. But it could take us days to reach some of them. So lets say we're currently at Kummer City in the Andere system.

    trade.py run --from "andere/kummer city"
        --credits 5000 --capacity 8 --ly-per 8.56 --jumps 2 --hops 2

(The above represents a single line)

That's a lot to type. TD is designed to support laziness when it comes to typing, so it allows for all kinds of short-cuts.

    trade.py ru
        --fr and/kumm     find a station matching 'kumm' in a
                          system matching 'and'
        --cr 5k           'k', 'm' and 'b' are recognized suffixes
        --cap 8           8 units of cargo
        --ly 8.56         maximum distance *per jump*
        --ju 2            maximum 2 jumps

The default for hops is 2, so I didn't have to include it.

You can also use "=" to connect an option with its values:

    trade.py ru --fr=and/kumm --cr=5k --cap=8 --ly=8.56 --ju=2

With the data at the time I write this, this produces:

    ANDERE/Kummer City -> ANDERE/Malzberg Vision
      ANDERE/Kummer City: 6 x Titanium, 2 x Polymers,
      G 224-46/Lorrah Dock: 7 x Coltan, 1 x Lepidolite,
      ANDERE/Malzberg Vision +8,032cr (502/ton)

This tells us our overall route (line #1), what load to pick up from the first station, what to sell it for and pick up at the second stop and where to finish and unload for our final profit.

Note that it could have just told us to pick up 6 Titanium (the max we could afford) or 8 Copper (the highest profit we could fill up with), Instead, TD crunched hard numbers and maximized the earnings of every cargo space AND credit.

##TIP: Last stop

Consider the last hop of a route as "best dumping ground". It is the only step TD doesn't think about "what next", so it's possible to arrive at a station that doesn't have much (or anything) worth buying. To avoid this, it's worth asking TD for 1 or 2 additional hops.

    trade.py ru --fr=and/kumm --cr=6.2k --cap=8 --ly=8.56 --ju=2 --hops 5
    ANDERE/Kummer City -> G 224-46/Lorrah Dock
      ANDERE/Kummer City: 7 x Titanium, 1 x Copper,
      G 224-46/Lorrah Dock: 8 x Coltan,
      ANDERE/Maury Terminal: 2 x Indium, 4 x Titanium, 1 x Copper, 1 x Aluminium,
      G 224-46/Lorrah Dock: 8 x Bertrandite,
      ANDERE/Maury Terminal: 4 x Indium, 4 x Titanium,
      G 224-46/Lorrah Dock +26,540cr (663/ton)

Malzberg was a great place to sell, but not such a great waypoint.

##TIP: Earn as you go

TD takes into account the money you make along a trip (see --margin), in the 5 hop route we see the cargo loads changing as TD sees you becoming able to afford more expensive-but-profitable wares. This is another reason it can pay to ask for more hops than you intend to make.

##How do I get there?

While one of TD's sub-commands, "nav", can help with that:

    trade.py nav and/kumm --via g224-46 andere --ly=8.56
    System     JumpLy
    -----------------
    ANDERE       0.00
    LTT 14542    6.16
    G 224-46     3.71
    LTT 14542    3.71
    ANDERE       6.16

We can also just ask TD to give us more detail with our trade run using the "--show-jumps" option or it's short-cut "-J":

    ANDERE/Kummer City -> ANDERE/Malzberg Vision
      ANDERE/Kummer City: 6 x Titanium, 2 x Polymers,
      Jump ANDERE -> LTT 14542 -> G 224-46
      G 224-46/Lorrah Dock: 7 x Coltan, 1 x Lepidolite,
      Jump G 224-46 -> LTT 14542 -> ANDERE
      ANDERE/Malzberg Vision +8,032cr (502/ton)

##Getting more (or less) detail

All TD commands can be asked more or less detail using either "--detail" (short-cut -v) or "--quiet" (short-cut -q). These are incremental, so "-vvv" or "-v v v" ask for 3 levels of increase, "-qq" asks for 2 levels of quiet.

    trade.py run --fr And/Kum --cr 5k --cap 8 --ly 8.56 -J -vv
    ANDERE/Kummer City -> ANDERE/Malzberg Vision (score: 8035.649800)
      Load from ANDERE/Kummer City (1.18Kls, BMk:N, Pad:L, Shp:Y, Out:Y, Ref:Y):
            6 x Titanium        803cr vs    1,306cr, 20 days vs 53 days
            2 x Polymers         76cr vs      280cr, 20 days vs 53 days
      Jump ANDERE, 6.16ly -> LTT 14542, 3.71ly -> G 224-46

      Load from G 224-46/Lorrah Dock (729ls, BMk:N, Pad:M):
            7 x Coltan        1,132cr vs    1,735cr, 53 days vs 8 days
            1 x Lepidolite      428cr vs      813cr, 53 days vs 8 days
      Jump G 224-46, 3.71ly -> LTT 14542, 6.16ly -> ANDERE

      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Finish at ANDERE/Malzberg Vision (493ls, BMk:N, Pad:L, Shp:Y, Out:Y, Ref:Y) gaining 8,032cr (502cr/ton) => est 13,032cr total

There's a lot going on here:
    . Fine detail about stations (distance from star, has black market, etc),
    . "score" tells us how TD ranked this based on factors such as total gain, supercruise distances, number of jumps, etc,
    . Expected purchase/sale costs and rough data age (some crowd-sourced data can appear to be very old if it hasn't changed),
    . How much we expect to gain each hop and the cr/ton we make,

Most users tend to use the in-game route planner and prefer the cleaner "--summary" presentation:

    trade.py run --fr And/Kum --cr 5k --cap 8 --ly 8.56 -vv --summary
    ANDERE/Kummer City -> ANDERE/Malzberg Vision (score: 8035.649800)

            2 x Polymers         76cr vs      280cr, 20 days vs 53 days
        Expect to gain 3,426cr (428.25cr/ton)

      Load from G 224-46/Lorrah Dock (729ls, BMk:N, Pad:M):
            7 x Coltan        1,132cr vs    1,735cr, 53 days vs 8 days
            1 x Lepidolite      428cr vs      813cr, 53 days vs 8 days
        Expect to gain 4,606cr (575.75cr/ton)
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Finish at ANDERE/Malzberg Vision (493ls, BMk:N, Pad:L, Shp:Y, Out:Y, Ref:Y) gaining 8,032cr (502cr/ton) => est 13,032cr total

##It's been a long time...

So you installed TD and you got crazy and you asked it to calculate 150 hops for you, and there was silence. If you specify the "--progress" option it'll tell you what's going on.


#TradeDangerous: Setup
At the moment, the primary interface to TradeDangerous' goodness is through a command line tool, "trade.py". I've built TD in a modular, open source way so that other programmers can use it to power their own tools; hopefully tools with web or graphical interfaces.

For instructions on how to get setup with TD see the wiki at: [http://bitbucket.org/kfsone/tradedangerous/wiki/](http://bitbucket.org/kfsone/tradedangerous/wiki/) and click the "Setup Guide" link.


#Command Line Options
TD functionality is broken up into "sub-commands". For instance, when we refer to the `update` command, we mean `trade.py update â€¦`.

If you run `trade.py` without any commands or options, it will give you a list of the sub-commands available. You can find out more details about a specific command, such as 'local', by typing:

    trade.py local --help

Each command has a number of optional/required arguments that can be specified.

Optional arguments are denoted by a keyword that starts with one or two dashes (`--from`, `-S`). The difference between long and short versions? Readability. You can also 'stack' short versions, for example `update -F -G -A` can be written as `update -FGA`

There are "switches" which turn a feature on or off, such as `--detail` which makes the command more verbose or --quiet` which makes it less noisy.

Other options are "parameters" which take a value, for example `--from Sol` would state the starting location for a command. You can write these as `--param value` or `--param=value`. You can often get away with just the first couple of letters, e.g. `--cr` for `--credits`.

In the list below, you'll see `--detail` and `-v` listed together. This indicates that `-v` is the short-form for `--detail`.

##Filing under D for Default
You can store preferred/default arguments/options in text files called "fromfiles". Each command automatically looks for a file called ".tdrc_<command>", so for the shipvendor
command it looks for ".tdrc_shipvendor". Note the leading '.'. You can also specify your own "fromfiles". See "Fromfiles" below for more details.


##Basic Usage:

    trade.py command arguments


###Common Options:
  These can be used with ALL TD commands

     --detail
     -v
       Increases the amount of detail given when showing routes or running the
       checklist system. Each use increases the detail, i.e. "-v -v" will
       give you more detail than just "-v". Short version stacks, e.g.
       "-v -v -v" is the same as "-vvv"

     --quiet
     -q
       Reduces the verbosity of the program. For example,
         trade.py -qq cleanup
       Will run the command with no output unless an error occurs.
       NOTE: --detail and --quiet are mutually exclusive.

     --debug
     -w
       Gives some additional information on what TD is doing while running,
       each use increases the verbosity: i.e. --debug --debug is more verbose.
       Short version is stackable, e.g. "-w -w -w" or "-www"


###Sub Commands:

For additional help on a specific command, such as 'update' use

    trade.py run â€¦
      Calculates a trade run

    trade.py update â€¦
      Provides a way to enter/update price data for a station

    trade.py nav â€¦
      Calculates a route between two systems

    trade.py import â€¦
      Reads prices from a file and loads them into the cache

    trade.py buy â€¦
      Finds places to buy a given item/ship

    trade.py sell â€¦
      Finds places to sell a given item

    trade.py trade â€¦
      Reports on trades from one station to another

    trade.py market
      Summarizes the market at a specific station

    trade.py station
      View, add, update or delete station data

    trade.py local â€¦
      Lists systems (and optionally, stations) in the vicinity of a given system

    trade.py rares â€¦
      Helps to find rare items.

    trade.py olddata â€¦
      Lists old data

###Advanced Commands:

    trade.py buildcache
    Rebuilds the cache (data/TradeDangerous.db)

    trade.py export â€¦
    Exports data from the db to .csv files

    trade.py station â€¦
    Query, add, update or remove stations

##RUN sub-command:

  This command provides the primary trade run calculator functionality (it provides the functionality of the older TradeDangerous versions prior to 3.1)

###Ship/Trade options:
     --capacity N
     --cap N
       Maximum items you can carry on each hop.

     --credits N
     --cr N
       How many credits to start with, where N can be an exact number or
       can use a suffix such as 20k for 20,000, 2.5m for 2.5 million or
       1.25b for 1.25 billion
       e.g.
         --credits 20000
         --credits 20k
         --credits 15.2m

     --ly-per N.NN
     --ly N.NN
       Maximum distance your ship can jump between systems at full capacity.
       NOTE: You can increase your range by selling your weapons.
       e.g.
         --ly-per 19.1
         --ly-per 3

     --empty-ly N.NN
     --emp N.NN
       DEFAULT: same as --ly-per
       How far your ship can jump when empty (used by --start-jumps)

     --limit N   DEFAULT: 0
       If set, limits the maximum number of units of any cargo
       item you will buy on any trade hop, in case you want to
       hedge your bets or be a good economy citizen.
       e.g.
         --capacity 16 --limit 8

     --insurance N   DEFAULT: 0
     --ins N
       How many credits to hold back for insurance purposes
       e.g.
         --insurance 1000
         --ins 5000
         --ins 1.2m

     --margin N.NN   DEFAULT: 0.01
       At the end of each hop, reduce the profit by this much (0.02 = 2%),
       to allow a margin of error in the accuracy of prices.
       e.g.
         --margin 0      (no margin)
         --margin 0.01   (1% margin)

###Route options:
     --from <station or system>
       Lets you specify the starting station
       e.g.
         --from @Asellus/Beagle2
         --fr beagle2
         --fr asellusprim

     --to <station or system>
       Lets you specify the final destination. If you specify a station, it
       will finish at that exact station. If you specify a system, it will
       try all the stations in the target system.
       e.g.
         --to Beagle2
         --to lhs64

     --shorten" (requires --to)
       Will show routes with fewer hops than the maximum if they produce a better gpt
       e.g.
         --to Beagle2 --hops 4 --shorten

     --towards <goal system>
       Builds a route that tries to shorten the distance from your origin
       and goal. Destinations that would increase the distance are ignored.
       Tries to avoid routes that go backwards or detour. If you want to
       avoid multiple visits in the same system, use --unique.
       e.g.
         --from iBootis --to LiuBese

     --loop
       Look for routes which loop back on themselves within the given number
       of hops, but it may also find shorter routes.
       e.g.
         --from iBootis --loop
         --loop --hops 4   (looks for 2, 3 and 4 hop loops)

     --loop-int N
     -li N
       Will require a minimum of N hops before visiting the same station.
       e.g.
         --from iBootis --loop-int 3

     --via <station or system>
       Lets you specify a station that must be between the second and final hop.
       Requires that hops be at least 2.
       e.g.
         --via Enterprise
         --via Chango

     --hops N
       DEFAULT: 2
       Maximum number of hops (number of cargo pickups)
       e.g.
         --hops 8

     --jumps-per N
     --jum N
       DEFAULT: 2
       Limit the number of systems jumped to between each station
       e.g.
         -jumps-per 5

     --direct
       Assumes a single hop and doesn't worry about travel between
       source and destination.
       e.g.
         --from achenar --to lave --direct

     --start-jumps N
     -s N
       Considers stations from systems upto this many jumps from your
       specified start location.
         --from beagle2 --ly-per 7.56 --empty 10.56 -s 2

     --end-jumps N
     -e N
       Considers stations from systems upto this many jumps from your
       specified destination (--to).
         --to lave -e 3      (find runs that end within 3 jumps of lave)

###Filter options:
     --max-days-old N.NN
     -MD N.NN
       Filters out price data that exceeds a specified age in days
       e.g.
         --max-days-old 7     (data less than a week old)
         -MD=2                (data less than 2 days old)

     --gain-per-ton credits
     --gpt credits
       Only consider trades which generate at least this much profit
       per ton of cargo traded. Be aware that this can prevent TD from
       finding highly profitable routes that would require you to take
       a drop in profit to reach, so you may want to consider using this
       in conjunction with --start-jumps or --end-jumps.
       e.g.
         --gpt 1200
         --gpt 1.5k

     --max-gain-per-ton credits
     --mgpt credits
       DEFAULT: 10,000
       Sets an upper threshold on the maximum profit/ton that TD will
       believe. This is a way to avoid bad data.
       e.g.
         --mgpt 2000
         --mgpt 2k

     --supply N
       Only consider purchases where the station has this many units of
       the item in supply,
       e.g.
         --supply 1000

     --demand N
       Only consider sales at stations which have this much demand for
       the given item,
       NOTE: The demand column is rarely populate, so using this option
       will hide the majority of available trade data from the optimizer.
       e.g.
         --demand 5000  (only show places users have entered a demand >= 5000)

     --pad-size SML?
     --pad SML?
     -p
       Limit results to stations that match one of the pad sizes
       specified.
         --pad ML?            (medium, large, or unknown only)
         -p ML?               (medium, large, or unknown only)
         --pad ?              (unknown only)
         --pad L              (large only, ignores unknown)

     --no-planet
       Require stations to be in space.

     --black-market
     --bm
       Only consider stations that have a black market.

     --ls-penalty N.NN
     --lsp N.NN
       DEFAULT: 0.5
       Reduces the score of routes by this percentage for every 1000ls
       you have to travel to stations, which helps prioritize routes
       with a shorter supercruise time.
       e.g.
         --ls-penalty 2.5
         --lsp=0              (disables this feature)

     --ls-max N
       DEFAULT: 0
       Filter stations by their distance-to-star. Stations for which
       distance-to-star is known that have a distance above this will
       not be considered for trading.
       e.g.
         --ls-max 10000
         --ls-m 32000

     --prune-score N.NN
       DEFAULT: 0
       After a number of hops (controlled by --prune-hops), eliminate
       a percentage of the routes from the lowest up by score.
       NOTE: This can speed up long run calculations, but it can also
       cause you to miss gold-mines that are a just a few hops awayâ€¦
       e.g.
         --prune-score 12.5   Removes the bottom 1/8th of (12.5%) of routes
         --prune-score 50     Only keep the upper 50% of routes

     --prune-hops N
       DEFAULT: 3
       Being applying "--prune-score" from this hop onward. Set 0 to disable.
       NOTE: This can speed up long run calculations, but it can also
       cause you to miss gold-mines that are a just a few hops awayâ€¦
       e.g.
         --prune-hop 4 --prune-score 22.5

     --avoid ITEM/SYSTEM/STATION
     --avoid AVOID,AVOID,â€¦,AVOID
     --av ITEM/SYSTEM/STATION
     --av AVOID,AVOID,â€¦,AVOID
       Excludes the item/system/station matching the name from the database
       e.g.
         --avoid Gold
         --avoid Aulin
         --avoid Enterprise
         --avoid prise
         --av gold,aulin,enterprise,anderson

     --unique
     --uni
       Only show routes which do not visit any station twice

###Other options:
     --summary
       Uses a slightly different format for showing trade routes,
       especially useful for longer routes in conjunction with -vvv

     --progress
     -P
       Show progress updates as TD calculates the route

     --show-jumps
     -J
       Describe route between each hops

     --routes N   DEFAULT: 1
       Shows the top N routes;

     --checklist
     --check
       Walks you through the purchases, sales and jumps of your route.
       Note: More verbose when used with --detail

     --x52-pro

##UPDATE sub-command:

For maintenance of your local prices database. The default is to walk you through a list of all the prices known for the station. You can either   hit enter or type the correction.

Alternatively, if you specify one of the editing switches, it will put the prices for a given station into a text file and let you edit it with your favorite editor.

    trade.py update

###Options:

    --gui
    -G
      Enables the new built-in GUI.

    --front
    -F
      [With --gui/-G]
      If ED is running in windowed mode, keeps the TD gui infront of
      of the ED window.

    --window-x nnn, --window-y nnn
    -wx nnn, -wy nnn
      [With --gui/-G]
      Lets you position the update window. Use negative values to
      anchor to the right/bottom of the screen.
      e.g.
        trade.py update -GF -wx=-220 -wy=200

    --height nnn
    -H nnn
      [With --gui/-G]
      Specifies the default heigh tof the update window.

    --all
    -A
      Shows all items including those not currently available at the station.

    --use-demand
    -D
      Enables editing of the "demand" column.

    --editor <executable name or path>
      e.g. --editor "C:\Program Files\WibbleEdit\WibbleEdit.exe"
      Saves the prices in a human-readable format and loads that into
      an editor. Make changes and save to update the database.

    --timestamps
    -T
      [With text editor only]
      Exposes the "timestamp" column.

    --force-na
    -0
      Changes the default demand/supply to be "n/a".
      CAUTION: "n/a" indicates that the item is either not bought
      or not sold at this station, and TD will ignore it accordingly.

    --sublime
    --subl
      Like "--editor" but finds and uses the Sublime Text editor (2 and 3).
      You can use "--editor" to tell it exactly where the editor
      is located if it fails to find it.

    --notepad
    --note
      Like "--editor" but uses notepad as the editor.

    --npp
      Like "--editor" but tries to use Notepad++ as the editor.
      NOTE: You will have to exit notepad++ completely before trade
      is able to process the changes you have made.

    --vim
      Like "--editor" but tries to use the VI iMproved editor.
      Mostly applies to Linux, Mac and Cygwin/Git installs.

###Examples:

    trade.py update "aulin enterprise" --notepad
    trade.py update chango --subl --supply
    trade.py update anderson --editor "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\WordPad.exe"
    trade.py update wcm --timestamps
    trade.py update --sup --time --zero aulin

  aka:

    trade.py update --sub -T0 aulin


##IMPORT sub-command and plugins:

Provides mechanisms for loading data, epsecially price data, into the local database, using either "import" or "merge" modes.

Both modes operate on a station-by-station basis: you can import data for a single station or every station.

For instance, if you "updated"d a station and there was an error importing it, your data is saved as "prices.last". Edit this file, correct the errors and then "import" it, rather than having to re-enter all of the data.

###Import Mode (default):
- Overwrites local data even if the import data is older,
- Items are removed from stations when there is an explicit "0 0" entry or there is no entry for the item at the station in the import file.

###Merge Mode (--merge):
- Items are only imported if they are newer than the local data,
- Items are removed from stations only when there is an explicit "0 0" entry that is newer than the local data.

###Plugins:

TD also supports the concept of an "import plugin". These are user-contributed extensions to TD that will fetch data from a 3rd party, such as Maddavo's Market Share, and populate the local database with that information.  (see http://www.davek.com.au/td/)

Plugins are specified with the "-P" option and can have their own options, not listed here, with the "-O" option. See "-O=help" for a list of the options provided by a particular plugin.

###Options:

    trade.py import
        [-q | -v] [--ignore-unknown] [--reset-all]
        [filename | url | -P <plugin> -O <options>]

    filename
      Specifies the name of the file to load
      e.g.
        import.prices

    url
      Specifies web address to retrieve the data from
      e.g.
        http://kfs.org/td/prices

####".prices" import mode options:
    --ignore-unknown
    -i
      Any systems, stations, categories or items that aren't recognized
      by this version of TD will be reported but import will continue.

      Unrecognized stations in the ".prices" file, or an import, will
      have a placeholder station entry automatically created for them.

      Note: When the cache is rebuilt, these stations will be lost, so
      you may need to add the "-i" flag to the buildcache command.

    --merge-import
    --merge
    -M
      Existing data is only overwritten by entries from the .prices file
      that have a newer timestamp and data is only removed if there is
      an explicit entry in the file with 0 demand/supply prices.

    --reset-all
      CAUTION: DANGER ELITE ROBINSON
      Deletes all existing prices from the database.

####Plugin options:
    --plug <plugin>
    -P <plugin>
      Specifies a plugin to use instead of the default .prices importer,
      By default "TD" comes with a plugin that supports Maddavo's Market Share
      (http://www.davek.com.au/td/)
      e.g.
        -P maddavo

    --option <option>
    --option <option1>,<option2>,...<optionN>
    -O <option>,...
      Passes options to a plugin.
      e.g.
        -O left,right
        -O help

##MADDAVO's "import" plugin:

Maddavo's Market Share is a 3rd party Elite Dangerous crowd sourcing project that gathers system, station, item and other data. This is the recommended way for TradeDangerous users to get their data.

The "maddavo" plugin provides a simple way to fetch and import updates from Maddavo's site.

To take maximum advantage of Maddavo's services, you should consider using "-O csvs" periodically.

###Basic usage:

    trade.py import -P maddavo
      This will check for and import new data from Maddavo's site. If
      you have newer data of your own, it will not be overwritten.

    trade.py import -P maddavo -O csvs
      Starts by checking for new Systems, Stations, ShipVendors, etc,
      listed in the ".csv" files Maddavo makes available.
      Then imports prices.

###Options (-O):
    csvs:         Merges all supported .CSVs (Systems, Stations,
                  ShipVendors, RareItems) and implies "exportcsv".
    systems:      Merge maddavo's System data into local db,
    stations:     Merge maddavo's Station data into local db,
    shipvendors:  Merge maddavo's ShipVendor data into local db,
    exportcsv:    Regenerate System and Station .csv files after
                  merging System/Station data.
    csvonly:      Stop after importing CSV files, no prices,
    skipdl:       Skip doing any downloads.
    force:        Process prices even if timestamps suggest
                  there is no new data.
    use3h:        Force download of the 3-hours .prices file
    use2d:        Force download of the 2-days .prices file
    usefull:      Force download of the full .prices file

##Elite Dangerous Mobile API import plugin:

Frontier provides an API for their mobile app. This can be used to report accurate information about your currently docked station such as market prices, shipyard, and other station information. The "edapi" plugin provides a way to accurately import this information into your prices file and optionally report the market prices to EDDN.

###Basic usage:

    trade.py import --plug edapi
      This will query the API for information abotu your currently docked
      station and import any market prices and shipyard information
      available. You will be prompted to enter any missing station information.

    trade.py imp -P edapi -O eddn
      This will do the same thing, but also post your market, shipyard, and
      outfitting modules to EDDN.

###Options (-O):

    eddn:  Post market, shipyard and outfitting to EDDN.
    csvs:  Merge shipyards into ShipVendor.csv.


##MARKET sub-command:

Lists items bought / sold at a given station; with --detail (-v) also includes the average price for those items.


    trade.py market <station> [--buy | --sell] [--detail]

###Options:

    station
      Name of the station to list, e.g. "paes/ramon" or "ramoncity",

    --buy
    -B
      List only items bought by the station (listed as 'SELL' in-game)

    --sell
    -S
      List only items sold by the station (listed as 'BUY' in-game)

    --detail
    -v
      Once: includes average prices
      Twice: include demand column and category headings

###Examples:
    trade.py market --buy ramoncity

    --stations
    -S
      Lists stations at each stop

    --refuel-jumps N

      jump on the route have a station. "--ref 2" would require that
      you not make more than one stationless jump after another.

    --pad-size ?SML
    -p ?SML
      Specify pad size required for a station to be listed or considered
      for refuelling stops. Specify one or all pad sizes you are want,
      DEFAULT: ?SML
      e.g.

##STATION sub-command:

This command can be used to add a new station:

    trade.py station --add "i bootis/nowhere port"
    trade.py station -a "i bootis/nowhere port" --ls 123 --pad m

Or it can be used to delete a station:

    trade.py station --remove "i bootis/nowhere port"
    trade.py station -rm "i bootis/nowhere port"

Or it can be used to update the ls-from-star, pad-size, or blackmarket flags of an existing station:

    trade.py station --update "i bootis/nowhere port" --pad=L --ls-from-star=123 --black-market=N
    trade.py station -u "i bootis/nowhere port" --pad L --ls 123 --bm=N

It can also be used to show some basic data about a given station:

    trade.py station -v i bootis/chango

    --tables TABLE[,TABLE,â€¦]
    -T TABLE[,TABLE,â€¦]
      Specify a comma separated list of tablenames to export.

    --all-tables
      Include the price tables for export.

    --delete-empty
      Delete CSV files without content.

###Examples:

    trade.py export --path misc
    Using database './data/TradeDangerous.db'

##RARES sub-command:

This command looks for known rare items within the space around a specified system.

    trade.py rare [-q] <system> [--ly N.NN] [--limit N] [--price-sort] [--reverse]

###Options:

     <system>
       System to center search on
       e.g.
         Lave
         @Sol

     --ly N.NN
       DEFAULT: 42
       Maximum distance to search from center system.
       e.g.
         --ly 0     (unlimited)
         --ly 21.2

     --limit N
       Maximum number of results to show
       e.g.
         --limit 10

     --reverse
     -r
       Reverse the order, can be used with "--ly" and "--limit" to find
       the furthest-away rares

    --away N.NN
    --from SYSTEM1 --from SYSTEM2 â€¦ --from SYSTEMN
      Limits results to systems that are at least a given distance away
      from additional systems.
      e.g.
        trade.py rare --ly 160 sol -r --away 140 --from lave
          Shows systems starting at 160ly or less from sol,
          but that are also 140ly or more from lave.
        trade.py rare --ly 160 sol -r --away 140 --from lave --from xihe
          As above but also compares for <= 140ly from xihe

#Fromfiles: Options in a can
A "fromfile" is a plain text file with TD command line options. For instance,
you could create a file for each ship specifying the --ly, --cap, --empty, etc.

You specify a fromfile on the command line by prefixing the filename with a '+'

So if you want to read "sidewinder.tdf" you would type

    trade.py nav +sidewinder.tdf

Of course, that's a lot to type, and we're trying to be lazy, so just go ahead
and call the file "sw" :)

    trade.py nav +sw

##Contents of a fromfile
A fromfile is simple: each line must correspond to one position on the
command line. So, "--empty-ly 30" becomes *two lines* while "--ly=20" is one.

    --empty-ly
    30
    --ly=20

##Default defaults: .tdrc files
Each TD command automatically looks for a file called ".tdrc_<command>", e.g.
".tdrc_shipvendor". Note the leading dot. If this file exists, the options are
read at the start of the command line.

So if you have the following .tdrc_nav

    --empty-ly
    30
    --ly=20
    -v

and you type:

    trade.py nav sol waruts -vv -ly=21

TD will behave as though you gave the command line:

    trade.py nav --empty-ly 30 --ly=20 -v sol waruts -vv --ly=21

Which is equivalent to:

    trade.py nav --empty-ly 30 sol waruts -vvv --ly=21

#Adding or Changing Price Data
##Experimental GUI in 6.0
As of v6.0 I've added an experimental GUI for updating prices. I'm still working out some of the issues, in particular you currently have to manually size and scroll the window.

To use it, simply type:

    trade.py update Aulin

or whichever station you need to update. While it is in experimental status, you'll be asked to provide an extra switch.

To **save** your changes, click the window's close button, *don't* alt-f4 or command-q.

To **remove** an item, set the 'paying' and 'asking' values to 0

To **navigate**

 * Use tab/shift-tab to cycle through cells
 * Use up/down arrows to move between rows
 * Press ENTER to move to the first column of the next line

To **add** items to a station, use the "-A" switch and leave the items you don't want empty.


##Other ways of editing Price Data

TradeDangerous uses a human-readable text format for price information. This is designed to closely resemble what we see in the market screens in-game.

To edit the data for a single station, use the `update` sub-command, e.g.

    trade.py update --notepad beagle2

This will open notepad with the data for Aulin, which will look something like:

    @ I BOOTIS/Beagle 2 Landing
     + Chemicals
        Explosives                 50      0        ?      -
        Hydrogen Fuels             19      0        ?      -
        Mineral Oil               100      0        ?      -
        Pesticides                 21      0        ?      -
     + Consumer Items
        Clothing                  300      0        ?      -
        Consumer Tech            1112   1111        ?    30L

"@" lines specify a system/station.

"+" lines specify a category.

The remaining lines are items, such as

    Explosives    50    0    ?    -


The fields used to populate items are:

 * `<item name>`
 * `<sale price>` (how much the station pays)
 * `<buying price>` (how much the station charges)
 * `<demand>` ('?' means "we don't care")
 * `<stock>`  ('-' means "not available")

So you can see the only item this station is selling is Consumer Tech, which the station wants 1111 credits for. The demand wasn't recorded (we generally aren't interested in demand levels since E:D doesn't seem to use them) and
the items wasn't available for purchase *from* the station.

TD will use the 'stock' values to limit how many units it can buy. For example, if you have money to buy 30 units from a station but the `.prices` data says only 10 are available, TD only tell you to buy 10 units and it will fill the rest of your hold up with other stuff.

Demand and Stock both take a "supply level" value which is either "?", "-" or the number of units followed by the level: L for Low, M for Medium, H for High or ? for "don't care".

    ?
    -
    1L
    23M
    3402H
    444?

Best Practice:

 * Leave demand as ?, neither E:D or TD use it
 * Stock quantities over 10k are usually irrelevant; you may leave them as ?,

For more details of the .prices format, see the wiki page: [https://bitbucket.org/kfsone/tradedangerous/wiki/Price%20Data](https://bitbucket.org/kfsone/tradedangerous/wiki/Price%20Data)

NOTE: The order items are listed within their category is saved between edits, so if you switch "Explosives" and "Hydrogen Fuels" and then save it, they will show that way when you edit this station again.

See `trade.py update -h` for more help with the update command.

#That's nice, but I'm a programmer and I want to â€¦

TradeDangerous is organized into modules, the key of which are:

 * trade.tradedb.TradeDB
   * Presents the main database API; it loads stations, systems, ships, items and provides query APIs for these.
 * trade.tradeenv.TradeEnv
   * Container for a bag of "properties" used across TD, such as debug level.
 * trade.tradecalc.TradeCalc
   * The best profit calculator
 * trade.tradeexcept.TradeExcept
   * Exception definitions
 * trade.mfd & trade.mfd.saitek
   * Multi-function display wrappers
 * trade.commands.commandenv.CommandEnv
   * Arg-parsing variant of TradeEnv
 * trade.commands.parsing
   * Helpers for creating argument lists for sub-commands
 * trade.commands.exceptions
   * Exceptions for sub-commands
 * trade.formatting:
   * Helper classes for presenting result sets

Minimalist usage example:

    import trade
    tdb = trade.TradeDB()

This creates a TradeDB instance using all-default parameters. It will take a while to complete because it loads the /entire/ database.

You can override the environment by passing a "TradeEnv", which itself can be initialized with an argparse namespace or by passing default overrides:

    import tradeenv
    # Defaulted:
    tdenv = TradeEnv()
    # Use with argparse to use command-line switches for defaults
    tdenv = TradeEnv(my_parser.parse())
    # Override defaults directly
    tdenv = TradeEnv(debug=1, detail=2)

    import tradedb
    tdb = tradedb.TradeDB(tdenv)

Construction of a wholly-default TradeDB can take a while because it loads a lot of data that you often probably won't need. You can speed it up by disabling the bulk of this with:

    tdb = TradeDB(tdenv, loadTrades=False)

If you subsequently need this data, call

    tdb.loadTrades()

As of TD 6.0 you should need to load this data less and less. A lot of work went into refactoring the SQLite DB and introducing more "lazy loading" by functions like `TradeCalc.getBestHops()`.

When TradeDB and TradeCalc do not currently provide built-in queries for the information you need, you can revert to the SQL Database with the `TradeDB.query()` and `TradeDB.fetch_all()` commands.
